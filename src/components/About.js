      <div>
        <p>I am a self taught programmer, with expertise building both the front and back-end of websites and applications. I love to solve problems, and programming allows me to tackle new and interesting problems each day.</p>
        <p>When I'm not programming, I work as a freelance violinist, performing in various ensembles throughout Colorado. With a musical background, I thoroughly enjoy creating products that help make musiciansâ€™ lives easier.</p>
