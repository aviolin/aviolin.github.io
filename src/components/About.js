      <h2>About me</h2>
      <div>
        <p>I am a self taught programmer, with development experience ranging from front & back end web development to video game programming. I love to solve problems, and programming allows me to tackle new and interesting problems each day.</p>
        <p>I love to create clean and modern online experiences. Responsive design, accessibility, and clean code are paramount to my work.</p>
        <p>When not programming, I work as a freelance violinist, performing in the Fort Collins Symphony, the Nebula Ensemble, in the recording studio, and at weddings. I enjoy creating products that help make musiciansâ€™ lives easier.</p>
